# Freshcuts-Mobile-Web-App
Mobile Web Application created in class


Project Approach


The project will utilize a Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach to speed up the development process. Considering that time is the most restricting aspect out of the triple constraints for this project, the RAD approach will most benefit the development process. 


	Phase I: Planning
Technical feasibility: Yes, the project can be made as a simple mobile application
Economic feasibility: No, the project will not be providing business value. It will provide a service for the user. However, the application can always be altered to provide business value later on. 
Organizational feasibility: Yes, there is a current market of users that will use the hairstyle mobile application. 
The risk of doing the project is not completing the project within the required time frame and risk time wasted
The risk of not doing the project is a failed grade
	
	Phase II: Analysis
	
The purpose of the hairstyle mobile application is the provide a faster service for individuals looking for specific hairstyles
The application is targeted to people who are more comfortable with smartphones and is practical for both genders
The project will be used for people looking for specific hairstyles to show their hairstyler, saving the trouble of looking on Google search images for unclear hairstyle pictures
The project manager is Adam Melaku and the rest of the team members are listed on the cover page
Version 1: This version will include basic search function and only for menâ€™s hairstyles
Version 2: This version should add a browse feature onto version 1 to improve user convenience and to link the hairstyle image to google search for more options
Version 3: This version should include a comment section for each hairstyle
Version 4: This version will begin adding female hairstyles into the application to open up new markets
Version 5: This version will add personal profiles that allow individuals to save specific styles of haircut


	Phase III: Design


The project use a prototyping-based methodology that will continuously improve on the prototype until it is suitable as Version 1
The specific file type has not yet been discussed
The type of mobile application that will be used as beta released has yet to be determined
The program design have not yet been determined. The project will include browse, search, and database features


	Phase IV: Implementation


System Construction: The project will be built at this part of the project life cycle. The application will be tested in beta version to ensure minimum number of bugs
System Installation: The project will require a development of a user manual built into the application. It will include a usage page that includes instructions on how to use the application properly
Support Plan: There will be a help button that allows user to contact the project team directly for issues regarding the application
